# Porsche 911 GT3 RS | Night Wolves Studio | Commercial Video Production Company

🚗 Objective:
For the Porsche 911, 🏁 Night Wolves Studio wanted to take a different approach from traditional ads, which often focus solely on the car's speed. Instead, we aimed to explore the car's timeless legacy and the brand's commitment to maintaining the authenticity of the 911, particularly the 911 GT3 RS, which Porsche promises will never be electrified. ⚡🚫

🎨 Creative Approach:
🔍 After extensive research into Porsche’s brand messaging, we learned that the company wanted to keep the 911 GT3 RS untouched by the shift to electric vehicles.

🌍 We decided to set the Porsche 911 in a dystopian future, where petrol-powered cars have been outlawed and erased from existence. The story revolves around a space organization or outer-station authorities monitoring Earth, picking up signals of an illegal technology.

🔥 The car’s engine roars to life in this world where its existence is considered a forgotten technology. As it completes a lap, the authorities attempt to stop it, but the driver, aware of being watched, vanishes into the night, leaving only darkness behind. 🌑🏎️💨

🛠️ Key Message:
📝 "Some legacies can never be erased." We created a narrative of rebellion and timelessness, showcasing the Porsche 911 as an untouchable, iconic machine that defies modern trends, especially in an electric age. 🚗⚡🚫
